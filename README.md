# Super Team

Visit at: https://willyamramos.dev/super-team

_Technologies Used: React, Typescript, HTML, CSS_

> "Super" = SuperHero/Supervillain

> THE Super Team page is to display my personal super team. 

This project utilizes a SuperHero API in order to construct a team of 5 supers which are individually rendered with a Card component.
The Card component adds up the Super's stats into a power level displayed at the top of the card. The team component then accumulates the power levels of the whole team to give the team an overall power level.

- The card displays stats and basic information of the Super on the back of the card which is revealed when hovered on. 


## Randomize Team

  - The randomize component gives the user 3 options:
    - Villain 
    - Hero
    - Mixed
    
  - Once the user selects an option and clicks the "Create Team" button, it will make a team of the selected option.

## Build Team

  - The Build Team component presents users with a input form in which they can input a Super's name to construct their Super Team of five.
  
  - If they attempt to render the team before sufficing the right amount of teammates or input an unknown name, the web app will alert the user with the     proper error.
