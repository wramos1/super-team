# Super Team

This project utilizes a SuperHero API in order to extract the data to construct a team of 5 supers individually rendered with a Card component. The card displays the Supers stats and basic information. The component ultimately adds up the Super's stats into a power level displayed at the top of the card. It then accumulates the power levels of the whole team to give the team an overall power level. 

The Randomize Team page allows users to randomize a team of either heroes, villains, or a mixture of the two. The Build Team component presents users with a input form in which they can input a Super's name to construct their Super Team of five. If they attempt to render the team before sufficing the right amount of teammates or input an unknown name, the web app will alert the user with the proper error.
